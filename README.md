# TIC_TAC_TOE_2.0

# Overview
This is a Java-based graphical Tic-Tac-Toe project that offers a user-friendly interface for playing the classic game. <br />
The project uses a total of 18 panels, 9 for each player, to represent the game grid.  <br />
The visibility of these panels is controlled by 9 buttons, each labeled with numbers from 1 to 9, to facilitate gameplay. <br />

# Features
Utilizes a graphical user interface (GUI) for a visually appealing gaming experience. <br />
Implements a 3x3 grid for the Tic-Tac-Toe game. <br /> 
Offers clear visual feedback on available positions with numbered buttons (1 to 9). <br /> 
Buttons become invisible once selected by a player to indicate the occupied position. <br /> 
The choice of panels (red or another color) is determined by the current player's turn. <br /> 
Provides an intuitive and engaging gameplay experience. <br /> 

# How to Play
Launch the application to start a new game. <br />
The game begins with player one (e.g., red) being prompted to make a move. <br />
Player one clicks on one of the numbered buttons to place their marker. <br />
The selected button becomes invisible, signifying that the position is now occupied by player one. <br />
Player two (or the other color) then takes their turn, following the same process. <br />
The game continues until one player wins or the game ends in a draw. <br />
A message will be displayed to indicate the game's outcome, and players can choose to start a new game. <br />
