# TIC_TAC_TOE_2.0

# Overview
This is a Java-based graphical Tic-Tac-Toe project that offers a user-friendly interface for playing the classic game. 
The project uses a total of 18 panels, 9 for each player, to represent the game grid. 
The visibility of these panels is controlled by 9 buttons, each labeled with numbers from 1 to 9, to facilitate gameplay.

# Features
Utilizes a graphical user interface (GUI) for a visually appealing gaming experience.
Implements a 3x3 grid for the Tic-Tac-Toe game.
Offers clear visual feedback on available positions with numbered buttons (1 to 9).
Buttons become invisible once selected by a player to indicate the occupied position.
The choice of panels (red or another color) is determined by the current player's turn.
Provides an intuitive and engaging gameplay experience.

# How to Play
Launch the application to start a new game.
The game begins with player one (e.g., red) being prompted to make a move.
Player one clicks on one of the numbered buttons to place their marker.
The selected button becomes invisible, signifying that the position is now occupied by player one.
Player two (or the other color) then takes their turn, following the same process.
The game continues until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.
A message will be displayed to indicate the game's outcome, and players can choose to start a new game.
